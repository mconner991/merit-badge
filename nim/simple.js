/* Nim Super Duper Simple  */
// declare variables for count (integer) and winner (string) as 0 and null. 
// set a loop to run until someone loses (counts 21 or over).
// the computer's turn is a random integer between 1 and 3
// add turn to count
// alert the computer's turn and the current count
// set the winner as "you" since, given the computer just went, you'd be the winner if game over. 
// if the computer didn't just count 21, do more stuff
// set turn equal to a prompt ("Count how many? 1-3") and parse that input as an integer
// add turn to count
// say the current count
// set the winner as "CPU" (since, if you just counted to 21, computer would win. 
// close the conditional
// close the loop
// alert that game is over and say who won.
